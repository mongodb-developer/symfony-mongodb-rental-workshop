This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of building a web application using Symfony â€“ a popular PHP framework, and MongoDB Atlas â€“ a fully-managed cloud database service by MongoDB. 

You'll learn how to set up a Symfony project, configure a MongoDB Atlas cluster, and perform CRUD operations using Doctrine MongoDB ODM. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a functional web application with a MongoDB backend, hosted in the cloud.

Make sure you have PHP and Symfony set up on your development machine, and sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account if you haven't already. Basic knowledge of Symfony and MongoDB will be helpful, but detailed steps will be provided throughout the workshop.
