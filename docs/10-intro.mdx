## Overview

This workshop is designed to guide you through the process of building a web application using Symfony â€“ a popular PHP framework, and MongoDB Atlas â€“ a fully-managed cloud database service by MongoDB. 

You'll learn how to set up a Symfony project, configure a MongoDB Atlas cluster, and perform CRUD operations using Doctrine MongoDB ODM. By the end of this workshop, you'll have a functional web application with a MongoDB backend, hosted in the cloud.

Make sure you have PHP and Symfony set up on your development machine, and sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account if you haven't already. Basic knowledge of Symfony and MongoDB will be helpful, but detailed steps will be provided throughout the workshop.

## MongoDB Atlas

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a fully-managed cloud database service that enables you to deploy, operate, and scale a MongoDB database in the cloud. It provides a range of features including automated backups, monitoring, and security features, and is available on all major cloud providers. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and connecting it to a Symfony application.

## ODM (Object-Document Mapper)
This project uses [MongoDB Doctrine ODM](https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm), which is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB and PHP. It provides a way to work with MongoDB in Symfony, using the same principles as Doctrine ORM for SQL databases.
Its main features include:
- Mapping of PHP objects to MongoDB documents
- Querying MongoDB using an expressive API
- Integration with Symfony's dependency injection and configuration system
